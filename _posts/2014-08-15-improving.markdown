Just added a simple cache system based on php mtime for my last tweet and for my instagram feed.

The cache will be regenerated every 24 hours.

In my spare time I'll improve this system being "notified" by Twitter and Instagram with a push notification.

Indeed I don't think this is kinda useful but, you know, the boredom of afternoon duty could be relieved by doing something pointless but fun.
