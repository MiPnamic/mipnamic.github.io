Well, as used to say: here we go again.

August is my month, I was born on the 31st in the far 1983, so I decided to renew everything.

In real, everyone are on vacancy, customers, friends and in between some projects I invested some time in this renewal process.

What's changed? I removed the "about me" page, too pointless, sincerely I don't think people are interested on "who I am", as a Developer, I think that they should be interested on "what I've done", "what I do" and "what I'll do".

That's all.
