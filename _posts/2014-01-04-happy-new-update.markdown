The first update of the year sees my [projects page][internal-projects] (reachable by my [bio][internal-bio]) updated with just few elements inside.

I'm trying to keep this website in a single-page layout and, at the moment, I have not intention to add more than one page per argument.

But, I know, there's a page that probably will become unstable... my [comments page][internal-comments]... Is not yet linked officially and probably will be not.

I love to leave some features reserved only to people who cares and read.

[internal-projects]: /developer/projects.html
[internal-bio]: /developer
[internal-comments]: /comments.html
