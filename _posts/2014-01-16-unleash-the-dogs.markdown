Famous last words: "more than one update per day" and now?

Projects use to get priority against funny things... such a shame...

BUT, here we are ! Things are going on as expected and soon I will be proud to publish more information about my work-in-progress projects and, why not? I will build a single page for each one of them, emphasizing what matters.

I'm focusing on what really matter now, because I understood how much time I was wasting on pointless things or meaningless people.
