			<p>My name is Marco Orlandin. I’m a 30-year old developer born in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vercelli" target="_blank">Vercelli (Italy)</a> with a grave addiction to problem solving.</p>
			<p>
				When I was 10 I got my first Internet Connection and by that day my life is literally changed. I started learning what today we call "front-end development" and a couple of years later I realized that it wasn't enought for me so I became a "back-end developer".
			</p>
			<p>
				7 years later I understood that what I wanted to do was to start my own business for being a full time developer and <a href="/business">so it was</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
				In my spare time I like to explore things, to experiment, to satisfy my curiosity, to learn new things.
