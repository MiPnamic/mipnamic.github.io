		<p>We are formerly a team but it doesn't seems.</p>
		<p>We use to brainstorm all together but in the practice it's rare to work all together on a single project.</p>
		<p>Some of us do not know all the team members, indeed some of us do not know that they are part of the team.</p>
		<p>We have a <a href="http://carnivorouscyborgs.tumblr.com" target="_blank">blog</a> where no one of us write about what we do.</p>
		<p>At this point I have to admit that all of this seems a joke but, believe me, we exist.</p>
		<p>We are planning to publish something this year (2014) and I'll update this page as soon as possible with our products.</p>
