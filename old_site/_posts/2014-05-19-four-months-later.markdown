Everything changes. Also the layout.

I'm wondering why I can't get the same layout for at least one year.

<div class="well">Big news: <strong>I quit</strong>.</div>

I was no more able to listen to people so blind to not see and understand their own errors.

I do auto critic. I practice a lot.

A workplace is not a place for whining. People who overestimate themselves deserve to be left alone with their own mirrors with the hope that one day they will face the reality, also people who underestimate themselves should not work with the first mentioned ones but try to grow up and leaving the nest.

Back in topic: Projects pages are near; therefore I lost against the all-in-one page layout.
