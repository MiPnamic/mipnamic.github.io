The renewal process of a personal website is always something interesting to analyze.

It's like a day-by-day automatic deployment system that produces tons of lines of codes, images, and also words. Words for the pages, for the bio, for the blog.

Yeah, the blog.

I'll never become a real blogger, I'm too lazy to write something different every day, or even worse, always about the same argument.

We we'll see if Jekyll will bring me back the desire to write, because here it is more like coding than writing.
